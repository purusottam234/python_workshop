# in python variables are introduced the same way as in math, by using the equal sign.

x= 2
# here x is a variable name and it store the value 2

print(x+1)


# changing types

y = 10
print(y)

y=y-10.0
print(y)
print(type(y))


x = 14
x = x+1
x=x/5
print(x**2)

#  for creating variable names 
# we cannot start variable name with number
# we cannot use the special characters in variable names
#


# for multiple variable

x = 5
y = 2
print(x + x - y ** 2)


# Pythonic way to assign variable in  one line
x,y = 8, 5
print(x//y)
